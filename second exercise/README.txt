The zip file contains the following content:
- README.txt (this file)
- max-flow,min-cut (main folder)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the max-flow,min-cut folder, there are 5 files:

- ford_fulkerson.py, which contains the main implementation required for this assignment
- graph.py, which contains the graph implementation [better implementation from the previous assignment]
- main.py, which contains the main function to run the program
- test, which contains the test case provided in the moodle
- mytest, which contains the test I created to test the program [also to check if new graph.py implementation works as expected]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the program, just run the main.py file in your terminal.
A prompt will ask you to input the file name with the graph data.
Then, the program will output the maximum flow and the minimum cut of the graph.

This was so hard for me to do, so I did not care about the efficiency test and my only goal was to complete the program before the deadline somehow.
I hope nothing goes wrong and the program works as expected. The new graph.py might have some bugs that I have yet to encounter.
